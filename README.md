# Smart Blind Stick â€“ Arduino Uno R3

A **smart blind stick** project built with **Arduino Uno R3** that helps visually impaired users by detecting obstacles and giving feedback using sensors, buzzer, and LED.

---

## ðŸ›  Components Used

- Arduino Uno R3  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (**HC-SR04**)  
- IR Sensor Module  
- LDR (**Light Dependent Resistor**) + 10kÎ© resistor (voltage divider)  
- Buzzer (Active or Passive)  
- LED + 220Î© resistor  
- Jumper wires & breadboard  
- 9V DC Battery (Power Supply)  
- SPDT Slide Switch (for power control)

## ðŸ”‹ Power Supply

- Powered using a **9V battery** through the SPDT switch.  
- All sensors and modules share a **common GND**.  

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: For better runtime, use a **USB power bank** or **6Ã—AA battery pack** instead of a 9V PP3 battery.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detects obstacles using **ultrasonic sensor** (distance-based alerts).  
- **Buzzer alerts** and **LED indicators** for feedback.  
- **IR sensor** helps detect closer objects quickly.  
- **LDR** checks light intensity for day/night detection.  
- Portable, lightweight, and **battery-powered**.

## ðŸ“¸ Suggested Diagram

- Block diagram showing connections between Arduino, sensors, buzzer, and LED.  
- (Optional: include a Fritzing diagram or wiring schematic for clarity.)

---

## âœ… Future Improvements

- Add **vibration motor** for haptic feedback.  
- Implement **left/right obstacle detection** using dual ultrasonic sensors.  
- Add **low-battery monitoring** with a voltage divider to an analog pin.
